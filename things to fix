things to work on and fix
1. make sure that random numbers generated are not repeated for the computer
2. generate ships for the computer without hard coding
3. fix the bug that causes the ships not to "erase" after new ship is being built
4. when ships are placed side by side, how to prevent overlap?
OR hard code the prevent overlap element by making sure that there is always a one cell surrounding the ship?
5. refactor code --> what is repeated, grp into functions or loops
6. need a restart button
7. if ship has not been placed and set ship was clicked ---> unable to continue placing ships --> look into this functionality
